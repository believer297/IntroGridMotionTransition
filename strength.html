						<h3>Why suffering is necessary for strength</h3>	
								</div>
								<div class="page-text">
						<p>“My unmatched perspicacity, coupled with sheer indefatigability, makes me a feared opponent in any realm of human endeavor.”

							-Emory Tate-
						</p>
							this is good all i want is to feel good about myself life is beautiful and has a lot to offer, 
							
							if you live enough you will understand that god doesn’t put things in your life randomly, every experience a man goes through is either a preperation for some responsability in the future or a reward / punishment for previous actions, 
							
							we have to think in terms of cause and consequences, that’s why i always tell people be careful what you wish for, if you decide to become the strongest person in the world and you really want that thing and you start praying for it or you start talking about it too much and you show the universe that you are really obsessed with it, guess what! from that moment you gonna start manifesting that thing which is in this case becoming the strongest person in the world and from this moment your are going to notice that life is bringing more obstacles in your way, and it could be mental or physical and that’s the only thing that’s gonna cause you to become stronger either mentally or physically, beacause the only way someone becomes strong is to go through hardships that’s the only way your brain is going to form defense mechanisms agains problems, that's called experience, and you may feel that your life became easy after that but the truth is you’re the one who’s gotten stronger, you will feel that your backpack became lighter but actually your back became stronger.  
							
							And maybe you wonder why my life is full of hardships and obstacles, even if i don’t have the desire to become the strongest person alive, let me explain to you in easy terms, when you where a baby you didn't know anything about life you didn’t know that life has a lot of bad things, you where innocent, so in order to achieve the minimum things in life and to grow be able to take care of yourself and you future children you have to go through hardships to become qualified for the minimum hardships and we can see this in many human realms, for example a bodybuilder has to destroy his body in order to grow muscle mass, that’s called hypertrophy and it occurs when the fibers of the muscle sustain damage or injury, the body then repairs damaged fibers by fusing them which increases the size and mass of the muscle. The same way your body has the ability to repair itself, the same way your psyche has the ability to heal itself after taking damage in order to be eligible to unlock the next level of the human endeavor. The more levels you will unlock the more life becomes easier and enjoyable. 
							
							And if you want to succeed in this life and the hereafter you has to have a fusion of indefatigability and perspecacity.
							
							This is not a therapy session. Go live your life. ❤️</p>
