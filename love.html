                        <div class="page-text">
                        <p>If two people started loving each other deeply in a crazy obscessive way their relashionship will be over immediately.</p>
                        <p>And i will explain this with a religious and psychological perspective:
                            Let’s imagine two people, they just met they like each other, they start to get comfortable with one another, now they're in love and they want to spend every minute they have seeing each other.
                            Now there’s nothing wrong with this relashionship, it’s essencial for couples to enjoy the company of each other and love and trust each other deeply, because this is how god created us. we we want to be loved as mush as we want love, the brain releases oxytocin everytime we hug someone we love even our pets experience the same chemical responce which is **Activation of Reward Pathways**: Falling in love triggers the release of neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin, and oxytocin in the brain's reward pathways. These neurotransmitters are associated with pleasure, reward, and bonding, leading to feelings of euphoria and happiness. So basically,  you become addicted to the person you love because everytime you get a validation from your partner you get these happy hormone doses that keeps you attached to that person. And now your brain tells you you should get more and more dopamine levels so you keep on trying to get validation from your partner, and someday when problems arrive which is completely normal and sometimes necessary for every relationship it could bring a lot of damage to both sides, as their bonding is simply dependent on love, if that love goes away someday which it will, they will simply split because they don't have any reasons left to be together.
                            
                            There are statistics that show traditional marriages are more successful than modern dating relationships that are based on love. It's really silly if you think about it for a second, most women think with their emotions wich is something catastrophic for making long term decisions, if you ask an unhappily married women:
                            
                            “what made you fall in love with you partner? “
                            
                            Your ears are going to hear the most irrational thing ever, they will most likely say something like, he had nice hair or he looked cute and i liked how he dresses.
                            
                            Im not saying that men taking care of themselves is a bad thing in fact people who take care of their grooming and look clean usually are good people.
                            
                            That's completely wrong. 
                            
                            There is something called the halo effect it's basically if you see someone who dresses well and look good all the time your mind tells you that person is successful and kind, that's human nature, we are likely to be pulled by beauty. 
                            
                            That's why companies spend millions of dollars on design.
                            
                            So a person who is beautiful does not mean he is nice, and a nice person is more likely to be beautiful as the beauty from the inside can reflect on the outside. I know a lot of people who doesn't even care how they look but somehow everybody loves them and loves their presence.
                            
                            That the beauty of the person's aura, in other words having good intentions towards people, and us as human beings can catch that energy and feel drawn to it.
                            
                             So instead of trying so hard to be liked by others (which is normal btw), spend more time fixing what's on the inside.
                            
                            Your subconscious.
                            
                            The subconscious mind has the ability to transform you into what you think you are.
                            
                            A famous Henry Ford quote, “**Whether you think you can, or you think you can't – you're right.** ”
                            
                            And he's actually right if you love, admire and respect yourself, you will start radiating good enrgy that's gonna draw people like you people that dignify, commend and praise themselves and the people around them. 
                            
                            And you will start to see change happen in your life, you will meet new people that align with your energy and you won't vibe with the people you used to vibe with.
                            
                            That's how you know you're on the right path.</p>
